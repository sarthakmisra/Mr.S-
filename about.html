<p>Hello guys I'm Mr.S . Life is hell . No one in this world cares  . I've never heard a person saying life is fair , it is not , it never has been , it wasn't meant to be and it never will be ! Never trust any person (stranger , not even if he's your friend). At the end it is only you who can help yourself in everything . The world sucks . Hindus believe that universe was created by Brahma while Stephen Hawking once said that once there was nothing literally nothing before a small ball kind of thing exploded and the universe was created . Can you imagine having nothing ? How nice whould it be . Nothing . Never keep expectations from anyone and keep trying your best until you achieve success . And if you understand my feelings then view my animations and channel in the next page. Â¡Adios Chicos!</p>
